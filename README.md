# [Use Web Components in Vanilla JavaScript][published url]
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


Web Components are a collection of 4 distinct technologies that come together to form a new way to package and reuse self-contained components built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The four technologies that together make up Web Components are: Templates, Custom Elements, the Shadow DOM, and HTML Imports. Web Components are an emerging spec, not yet fully supported in all browsers, but they have the promise to change the way we code for the web.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will show you how to create Web Components without using any additional frameworks like Polymer or x-tag. You'll learn how to transform an existing HTML and CSS template into a web component, how to register it with a custom tag name and how to import that component from another file.
